        <p>
            I am Mousa Sabah, I am an electrical power engineer, I have graduated in 2019, and I have worked for one year in the field of student education
In my last university year, I worked on a graduation project, and it was a simulation using MATLAB programming, and it caught my attention and I enjoyed the project It was the coding and simulation programming part by using Simulink, and from that time I was not interested in any science except for software development and coding.
Here I am training in ASAC to be software development
